# Privacy Statement | USENIX

The following statement discloses The USENIX Association's information gathering and dissemination practices.

The USENIX Association maintains member databases that contain mailing, billing, and member profile information, as well as a record of each member's product purchases and registrations for conferences. The information in these databases is used by authorized USENIX staff members to process orders; mail invoices, member benefits, renewal notices, and announcements; and respond to member inquiries. Member records are maintained as long as an individual is a USENIX member and for five years following a membership lapse. Purchase and registration databases may be retained for up to five years.

USENIX logs all accesses from your IP address to our Web site, and summary information derived from these logs may be displayed on the Web.

Personal information is stored in a relational database and standard security methods are used to protect it. We require confirmation of identity before releasing information back to the user for update over the Web.

Commercial information (such as credit card numbers) is obtained using our secure Web server. We do not store complete credit card information on our machines. If it is necessary to store sensitive data, we use public key encryption on it and require our staff to supply a private key to decrypt it. When passing such information internally over the Internet, we use our secure server.

### Electronic Communication

The USENIX Association does not rent or sell email addresses. USENIX may use email addresses to contact members to answer member questions or to acknowledge the receipt of membership applications and other orders, to send membership renewal notices, and to send occasional announcements about USENIX events to those members who have not opted out of receiving such announcements. These announcements are short, straightforward messages which contain pointers to online resources where members can explore the information more fully.

For conference registration, our third-party vendor, Cvent, uses Web beacons in email to improve our communications with you. If you use HTML-enabled email, they track when, how often, and where you open these emails. If you would like to opt out of tracking, turn off HTML display of email for cvent.com.

### Postal Mail

USENIX uses the postal addresses of its members to mail invoices, products, and announcements from USENIX and from its Corporate Supporters. The names and mailing addresses of members who have not opted out (see below) may be rented to outside organizations to send mailing packages that have been carefully screened by authorized USENIX staff for their suitability. USENIX member names and mailing addresses are never sold.

### Opt-Out

Our site gives you the opportunity to opt out from receiving email communications or from having your name and address made available to anyone other than the USENIX Association. When registering for a conference, you also have the option not to have your name included on the attendee list.

### Change/Modify

The USENIX site gives members the opportunity to change information previously provided, by [signing into their account](https://www.usenix.org/user), by phoning 510 528 8649, by faxing to 510 548 5738, or by sending email to [office@usenix.org](mailto:office@usenix.org). Note: Information is always updated whenever a new conference registration occurs and upon renewal of membership.
